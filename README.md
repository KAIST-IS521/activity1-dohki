# StrictCsv

`StrictCsv` wraps the built-in `python` library `csv` so that **only balanced csv** can be parsed. By balanced csv, it means the csv which has the same number of columns for each row.

## Usage
`python src/myprog.py [csv_file_name] [col_idx]`  
(e.g. `python src/myprog.py csv/rfc-4180-6.csv 2`)
